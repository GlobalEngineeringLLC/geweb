Tomorrow at 6:30am EST we will race the finals of the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series (DNLS). Our regular drivers Jan Philipp Springob and Marek Böckmann are unfortunately unable to participate due to their commitments with the "real racing team". In their place, the racedrivers Robin Rein and Christopher Kindler will be in the virtual cockpit of the # 111 “M&J Performance by Bremotion” Mercedes-AMG GT3. Tune in!

We have partnered with M&J Performance by Bremotion earlier this year to promote the virtual potential of the “Digital Nürburgring Long Distance Series” (DNLS). The logos of Skylines One will be presented on our #111 Mercedes-AMG GT3 racing car.

M&J Performance by Bremotion is a racing team with decades of experience in racing. Bremotion is a specialist in real-world racing that had a tremendous 2019 & 2020 season running their Mercedes-AMG GT4 in the German DTM Trophy (German Touring Car Trophy). The drivers for 2021 are Marek Böckmann und Jan Philipp Springob.

“We are thrilled to see the drivers Robin Rein and Christopher Kindler in the virtual cockpit of our # 111 "M&J Performance by Bremotion" Mercedes-AMG GT3. We are looking forward to showing maximum performance for Skylines One at the finals of the DNLS and are looking forward to a great race at 1pm!”, says Bremotion CEO Patrick Brenndörfer.

The DNLS, originally launched in 2020 as a COVID-19 replacement program, quickly became the audience's favorite in its first season. The format is based on the popular sim racing platform iRacing and offers a very high entertainment value. The races are held in four separate groups with separate trophies on the legendary Nürburgring-Nordschleife and the Grand Prix track; the maximum starting field size is 60 vehicles. M&J Performance by Bremotion starts with the #111 Mercedes-AMG GT3 in the top class "SP9". The next race is the "LEGO Technic 3h Race" this Saturday, March 6th, 2021 at 7am EST (1pm CET). The livestream and the replay can be accessed on https://facebook.com/skylinesone and here on our website.
