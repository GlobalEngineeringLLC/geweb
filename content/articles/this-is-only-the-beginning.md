Now, more than ever, online business is booming. With new technologies and the need of social distancing it is getting increasingly important to stand out of the crowd and be unique.
With the thought of uniqueness and limitlessness Skylines One LLC was founded.

In March 2020, Alex Mittler and Lars Artmann met at a deep-tech conference. They had no idea at the time what would happen over the coming months.

Alex Mittler is an international businessman with a deep knowledge and passion for technology. He has worked over a decade as an engineer at Apple Inc., held several executive positions and is also an active board member advising several well established companies. Alex is always open to new challenges.

Lars Artmann on the other hand is a passionate software engineer with over 7 years of experience in working with modern and future technologies, and his passion is for Cloud Technology & Kotlin. Don’t be fooled by his age - with his 17 years he already has successfully implemented the global rollout and payment system for one of the biggest coffee companies and released several smartphone Apps and is already a founding member of his second software company!

In April 2020 when Alex and Lars got to know each other better they found a common ground which was not only based on their passion for Counter-Strike but also on their mutual interest in software, it’s development and their thriving to make it easily accessible to everyone. Finally in June 2020 Skylines One LLC was born.

Both are eager to push their vision forward and with Lars’ passion and knowledge about software and development and Alex’s business experience they managed to sign their first big contracts that same month (June, 2020), one of them being a major player in eCommerce, with many more to come!

The concept itself is simple: create individual, simple and accessible software with a great user-experience - like Apple, who has really become a master at this. And, of course, deliver the same quality software & support for each individual client. The tricky part is the customization. Because each project is unique and has its own special needs and requirements, the software implementation needs to reflect that. With this vision at its core, Skylines One LLC and its team is determined to help each of their clients to let their business stand out of the crowd and be the number one on the software skyline!

So, let’s get started and #LetsCreateTheFuture, together.
