short: More options for the online world

As a startup one statement is not enough to define, where we want to go and what we want to achieve. It is a journey and its goals are as widespread as its customer. The primary goal, however, is to make software and apps accessible and manageable by every business owner, even though they are no tech pros!

In times like these improving online options for the clients is essential for businesses to survive. However, we did not start our journey because of necessity but out of passion. Therefore, we also want to get it across to our customer, that software and Apps are not just an instrument to improve business but a useful tool that is able to adjusts to the constant changing business goals and their customer needs.

The first step is to manifest ourselves, identify our clients’ needs and requirement, which, in itself is not easy as all our customers are unique such as their business. We don’t want to specialize in a certain industry sector or business direction as we as a Team are Allrounders and we want to give every business owner the opportunity to extend their business online with their individual software / App.

We also believe in learning by doing, therefore we keep in close contact to our clients, not just to help them out in case of questions or modifications but also for us to improve ourselves and let our products grow with the customer and business. Our work does not stop, when the software or App is up and running. But we will go the extra mile, to make sure that the software or App will continue to meet the needs and requirements of our clients.

Of course, a big goal is growth, but whose business isn’t? However, our past experiences and customer feedback shows us that we are on the right track, so we won’t stop, but get better!

Also, we are thinking outside the box, which means our mission for the future is not just to offer individual software and Apps to our customer, but also to offer software and apps to monitor and control whole processes such as the supply chain. Our goal is not only to ease the process in this example for the manufacturer, but also logistics, warehouse and even end customer, as all of them would be able to have access and different options.

But the biggest goal is to take out the fear of develop and run a software or App. Developers are still widely seen as geeks or nerds who spend 24/7 in front of their multiple screens and have problems socializing! Let us assure you, that is not the case! Besides, our Developers are rather handsome! But all jokes aside, developing and maintaining can be easy if explained in a way that everyone is able to understand! And this easy understanding is what we communicate to our customers. We are not only about presenting a product but also to enable our customers to use, maintain and optimize their software or App anytime they want. With or without our help.

If we reach those goals, we could say Mission accomplished and move on the new goals as technology will continue to develop and grow and so are we!
