“Just like Skylines One, we are thrilled to see new & innovative software-based solutions to start a new era of motorsports.

Therefore, we are proud to announce that Skylines One stepped on the gas together with M&J Performance by Bremotion”, says Marek Böckmann.

The DNLS, originally launched in 2020 as a COVID-19 replacement program, quickly became the audience's favorite in its first season. The format is based on the popular sim racing platform iRacing and offers a very high entertainment value. The races are held in four separate groups with separate trophies on the legendary Nürburgring-Nordschleife and the Grand Prix track; the maximum starting field size is 60 vehicles.
