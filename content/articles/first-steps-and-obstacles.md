Since its foundation, the Skylines One team made sure to deliver on its promise to offer building the greatest user experience out there. We are firm believers in quality as opposed to quantity. In other words, we find it extraordinarily fulfilling to be laser-focused on providing a hundred percent guaranteed satisfaction to our clients. Therefore, we want to be nothing but the best in the software market and gladly go the extra mile for our customers.

From the get-go, we have placed a great importance on making sure our online presence reflects our efforts in being the best in user experience (UX/UI), Kotlin and Cloud/Firebase applications. LinkedIn and Facebook, being among the platforms we’ve constantly made use of in order to get our name known. The truth is, allowing potential clients to get a clear-cut picture of who we are and what we do has always been one of our main goals. As far fetched as it may seem, for now, we’re aiming to become recognized worldwide. And, to achieve this, we’re planning on putting ourselves out there on social media to give everyone an insight of who we are and what we are doing! We want our clients to get to know us, as a company, but also as the individuals that make this company unique and special, therefore check our social media on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/skylinesone) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/skylinesone) for updates on the company, our team, our vision and our current and upcoming projects and promotions.


Getting the word out there while making our existing customers happy is pretty much all we focused on these past months. In fact, proving ourselves daily has been challenging for our team. However, our detail-oriented vision coupled with our strong determination has given us the extra push to continue moving forward and delivering top-notch results. Moreover, at Skylines One, we’re fully aware of the importance of taking enough time to do things right. Needless to say, we deeply believe in taking one step at a time when working towards our objectives and then don’t stop till it’s perfect for our client and us; just as our slogan implies #Letscreatethefuture.

At Skylines One, we value honesty. That’s why we don’t shy away from being authentic and truthful to our clients at all times. In other words, we are very straight forward about both our achievements and our shortcomings. As a result, it’s not hard for us to publicly admit that we’ve been facing a wide variety of challenges as a young company. Nevertheless, our clients can rest assured that our team’s professionalism and ability to overcome any obstacles is unmatched. Not only that, but we’re very aware about our own potential and will prove to be a successful tech venture.

As of now, finding the right talent for our sales and marketing teams has been an obstacle. However, we know this could easily be fixed by making sure our prospective employees are put through a rigorous admission trial. We’re all about quality as opposed to quantity and we are looking for open minded, thriving professionals who are willing to go the extra mile, like us, the current team at Skylines One.

We love to do our very best to meet and exceed our client’s expectations. Our user experience is unmatched, after all we model it after the late Steve Jobs who is the master of the topic. No matter what; we are here to make it perfect for you. We truly will “exceed not meet the expectations”!

Therefore, we thrive to get better and only the Sky(lines One) is the limit!
